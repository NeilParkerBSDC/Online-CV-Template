# Online CV Template
This Project provides the files to make a dynamic online CV

A CV is a document that often contains a series of tables of information (skills, education, employment history etc. which can be more efficiently created dynamically from a database table via than in a static html table. This contains the basic files to use as a basis for creating your own online CV/Portfolio.

# Planning

See [this document](https://github.com/NeilParkerBSDC/Online-CV-Template/commit/dea4541d0426367647c29a62c79c32c3bb1ed86c)

A CV will typically have sections on the following:
- Personal/contact details
- Personal Statement
- Skills
- Employment History
- Education
- Acheivements
- Projects
- Interests
- Etc.

It is proposed that a separate page be created for each of these. For the most part each page will have a corrsponding table in the dtaabase, although it would be good to be able to apply some relational linking of table e.g. skills and projects, skills amd ualifocayions etc.
